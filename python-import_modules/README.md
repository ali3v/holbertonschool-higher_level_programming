Python – Import & Modules

This project focuses on understanding how Python modules work and how to use them effectively. You will learn how to import functions from other files, create your own modules, explore objects with dir(), and control script execution using __name__ == "__main__". The tasks also introduce working with command line arguments while following Python style guidelines.
